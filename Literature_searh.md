# 1. User interface design patterns and ontology models for adaptive mobile applications
**Authors: Amani Braham, Feli Buendia, Maha Khemaja, Faiez Gargouri**   
## **Abstract**
Mobile applications are an essential element in pervasive and ubiquitous computing, and they face many challenges during their
generation process from the analysis of user needs to the design of specific mobile interfaces and their development in several
technological platforms. Moreover, the rise of Ambient Intelligent and context-aware environments also introduces multiple
interaction aspects to be considered when using mobile devices in this kind of scenario. The present work examines the
role of design patterns and ontology models to help generate mobile applications, which can be adapted at
runtime to the various user needs, context scenarios, interactive design modes, or technology requirements. In this way,
an ontology-based framework is introduced to represent, design, and support the adaptation of user interfaces in mobile applications by using design patterns according to these user needs or preferences and the context around them. This framework
provides developers with a client-server architecture that enables access to an expert knowledge base of user, context, and
pattern information together with a set of inference rules, which allow the dynamic selection of interface design patterns and the
runtime adaptation of the user interface features. These ontology models and inference rules are key components of the proposed
framework, and their implementation has helped to produce an example of a mobile application supporting user interface adaptation processes for disabled people, which can be required in Ambient Intelligent environments. Three examples of user
scenarios have been considered to assess the framework potential, and usability dimensions have been tested by a limited set
of users through the produced mobile application, making the usefulness of generated adaptive user interfaces apparent

# 2. Intention Recognition and Communication for Human-Robot Collaboration
**Authors: Hadi Banaee, Franziska Klugl, Fjolle Novakazi, and Stephanine Lowry**   
## **Abstract**
Human-robot collaboration follows rigit processes, to ensure safe interactions. In Case, of deviations from predetermined tasks, typically, processers come to a halt. This position paper proposes a conceptual framework for intention recognition and communication, enabling a higher granularity for understanding intentions to facilitate more efficient and safe human-robot collaboration, especially in events of deviations from expected behavior.
